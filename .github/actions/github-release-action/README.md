| PROJECT_NAME      | False    | See Below | Project/product name                        |
| RELEASE_TITLE     | False    | See Below | Title for the release                       |
| PRERELEASE        | False    | False     | Marks the release as a development release  |

| MAKE_LATEST       | False    | True      | Marks the release as the latest release     |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Note: GITHUB_TOKEN requires repository write permissions to create a release

### Project Name

When not provided, the project/product title will default to the repository name.

### Release Title

When not explicitly provided, the release title will be set to the compound value:

`[Project Name] [Build Tag]`

So, when the following values are enumerated by the release action:

```console
repository = osc-github-devops
build_tag  = v1.0.1
```

The GitHub release title would be presented as:

osc-github-devops v1.0.1
