Below is a sample matrix job configuration for this action:

```yaml
  python-tests:
    name: "Python Test"
    runs-on: "ubuntu-24.04"
    needs:
      - python-build
    #¬†Matrix job
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.python-build.outputs.matrix_json) }}
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: "Test Python project"
        uses: lfreleng-actions/python-project-test-matrix@main
        with:
          python_version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          report_artefact: true
```

In the above example, a prior Python build job has run (not shown).
